    <p>Part One previously covered <a href="https://exnihlio.github.io/posts/hardening-openssh/">here</a></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Hardening <code>sshd</code> consists of three main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using strong keys algorithms such <code>ed25519</code> or minimum 4096 bit RSA keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuring <code>sshd</code> to disallow root login and only to use public keys for
authentication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing the most common and lower level MACs and key types</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-generation">Key Generation</h2>
<p>Keys for OpenSSH are generated with the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command. By default,
this generates a 2048 bit RSA pub/priv keypair in <code>~/.ssh/</code>.</p>
<p>To change the bit size of the keypair, use the <code>-b</code> flag:</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -b</code></p>
<p>While a 2096 bit key is considered &lsquo;secure&rsquo; at this time, there have been
demonstrated attacks on weaker keys/exchange alogrithms. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logjam_(computer_security)">Logjam</a>.
To that end, this author recommends using 4096 bits at a minimum.</p>
<p>Howerver, <code>ed25519</code> keys and elliptic curve cryptography is/are much stronger.
In fact, the <code>ECDH</code> or Eliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange is recommended as mitigation
to the Logjam attack. For a more in depth look at elliptic curve cryptography, this <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">article</a> is
highly recommended.</p>
<p>Side Note:</p>
<p>If you work with legacy systems, particularly routers and switches, they may be running a much older version of
OpenSSH. Some of these may only support a Diffie-Hellman key exchange bit value of 1024 or lower, specifically
the <code>diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</code> algorithim. This will force an error when trying to connect with newer OpenSSH clients
later than OpenSSH 6.8.</p>
<p>To generate an <code>ed25519</code> key run:</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519</code></p>
<p><code>ed25519</code> keys are a fixed key length, so the <code>-b</code> option will not work. Note that <code>ed25519</code> keys are
not compatible with systems that are FIPS 140-2 or higher enabled, or with AWS CodeCommit. They <strong>will</strong> work with
both GitHub and GitLab however. <code>ed25519</code> keys have been supported in OpenSSH since version 6.5 and as such any modern
SSH client should support them.</p>
<p>If you encounter a system that does not support <code>ed25519</code> key types you can specify an alternate key.
In your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> add the following:</p>
<pre><code>Host $LEGACY_SYSTEM
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

</code></pre><p>Where <code>$LEGACY_SYSTEM</code> is the hostname or IP address of the of the host that does not support <code>ed25519</code> keys.</p>
<h2 id="sshd-configuration">sshd Configuration</h2>
<p>For the most part, OpenSSH has sane defaults out of the box. There are concessions in the name of ease
ease of use however. First is that root login is permitted. As a high percentage of drive by attacks
on SSH servers target the root account, any publicly available host is already vulnerable to compromise.</p>
<p>Second, login via password is also permitted. As passwords are difficult to remember, prone to re-use, and
accidental compromise they represent a significant security weakness.</p>
<p>To this end make the following changes in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.
First disable root login by changing the following line:</p>
<p><code>PermitRootLogin yes</code></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><code>PermitRootLogin no</code></p>
<p>and reload the <code>sshd</code> service:</p>
<p><code># systemctl reload sshd</code></p>
<p>Before removing password based logins, your SSH public key <strong>MUST</strong> be present in remote hosts <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
file. This file contains the public keys of all hosts that are allowed access.</p>
<p>Consider the aforementioned scenario in part one. <code>developer-1</code> will copy their keys to <code>bastion-1</code> in the following
manner:</p>
<p><code>ssh-copy-id ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub developer-1@bastion-1</code></p>
<p>Since password based logins are still allowed, <code>developer-1</code> is prompted for their password. When they enter it
successfully, the public key is copied to their remote home directory on <code>bastion-1</code>. Now when they attempt to log
in in the future, their local private key will be checked with their public key on the remote host. If they match,
they will be allowed to log in. If they do not match, then <code>sshd</code> will fall back and request a password.</p>
<p>If password authentication is disabled like so:</p>
<p><code>PasswordAuthentication yes</code></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><code>PasswordAuthentication no</code></p>
<p>and <code>sshd</code> is reloaded</p>
<p><code># systemctl reload ssh</code></p>
<p>When SSHing in again, there will be no password prompt. If your public key is not
in place on the remote system then the login is rejected.</p>
<p>Public key authentication is inherently more secure than passwords, though placing public keys can also be a bit
of a challenge. Tools like cloud-init, Ansible and SaltStack can also help with this, though discussion of these
is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that when SSHing through a jump host, authenticating to further systems can be difficult.
Naturally, storing your keys on every system is unsafe. This is where <code>ssh-agent</code> forwarding can be extremely helpful.</p>
<p><code>ssh-agent</code> forwarding adds your private key(s) to a local process. When you SSH to a remote system, adding the
<code>-A</code> flag the <code>ssh</code> command instructs the <code>ssh-agent</code> to forward the keys to the <code>ssh-agent</code> on the remote host.
These temporarily stored keys can then be used to authenticate to other hosts, without storing them on the system.
Whey you log out of the remote system, the keys are removed from the agent.</p>
<p>To add a key to your agent run the following:</p>
<p><code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code></p>
<p>To check the keys in your agent run the following:</p>
<p><code>ssh-add -L</code></p>
<p><code>ssh-agent</code> forwarding should only be done on systems you trust. A user with elevated rights can read the keys
out of the agent socket. Regardless, this is still a safer pattern that storing keys remotely or using passwords.</p>
<p>Part three of this guide will focus on reducing drive by login attempts and only allowing a few, highly secure key types
and MAC algorithms.</p>
