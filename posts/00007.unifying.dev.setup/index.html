    <p>I have been using VS Code pretty much exclusively for about two years now. But I have
decided to switch back to Vim + tmux. To that end, I want to unify my
experience across systems, as I use Ubuntu on my desktop and a Macbook.</p>
<p>My dotfiles, e.g. <code>.vimrc</code>, <code>.bash*</code>, <code>.tmux.conf</code> are all managed in git
and installed with a shell script. But I want to go further. I want a script
that will install my typeface(s) of choice, set up my vim plugins and configure my terminal
so that anytime I get a new system, I can just run <code>bash install.sh</code> and be
(mostly) good to go.</p>
<p>First I am creating a package file. This will contain any vim plugins,
typefaces, and other system packages to install. Next we need to install <code>jq</code>
to read this in. Which means <code>install.sh</code> needs to be able to work for Mac and Linux.</p>
<p>Next we will create and install our directories <code>~/.tmux/pack</code> directory. And clone down
our packages. At writing time, we are just adding <code>gruvbox</code> but there will be a few more
plugins to add as well. We also want this to be minimal. We are not rebuilding EMACS into
Vim.</p>
<p>While I have enjoyed using iTerm, I&rsquo;m looking into replacing it with Kitty. This is for several
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Kitty is multiplatform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kitty uses a single config file, which makes syncing with Git awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kitty has built in support for displaying images and that is AWESOME.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am also investigating Alacritty, because I do not really care about splitting windows
or fancy terminal stuff. Tmux will handle that for me.</p>
