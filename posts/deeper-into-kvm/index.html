<p>Having covered the basics of standing up a simple VM,
this guide will cover some of the more in depth aspects,
quirks, and potential landmines that come from using KVM.</p>
<h3 id="part-i-disks">Part I: Disks</h3>
<h4 id="creating-disks">Creating Disks:</h4>
<p>By default, when installing a VM and guest operating system,
libvirt can automatically provision a disk, as demonstrated
in the previous post. Libvirt can also use previously provisioned
disks. qemu-img is the most commonly used utility for
creating disks with KVM.</p>
<p>qemu-img is a highly flexible tool for creating virtual disks of
varying types, most commonly qcow2 or raw images, but it also has
support for several others including VMDK disks for VMWare and
legacy qcow images.</p>
<p>To create a virtual disk with qemu-img, invoke the following command:</p>
<p><code>qemu-img create -f qcow2 example_disk.qcow2 20G</code></p>
<p>This creates a virtual disks with the name ‘example_disk’,
formatted as a qcow2 image, of the size 20GB. If you examine the size of the file:</p>
<p><code>ls -alh example_disk.qcow2</code></p>
<p>We get the following:</p>
<p><code>-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 193K Oct 29 22:21 example_disk.qcow2</code></p>
<p>Qcow2 disks are thin-provisioned by qemu-img. Essentially, the
disk will expand as data is allocated to it (such as OS installation or file storage),
until it occupies 20GB of actual space. This is useful in some cases,
such as over-provisioning a physical disk with virtual disks.</p>
<p>Be aware, if you attach this disk to a VM, it will not see the
disk as 20GB in size. For using virtual disks, the option <code>-o prealloc=falloc</code>
will need to be used. This will use the <code>falloc</code> syscall and pre-provision the
disk. The disk will not actually consume 20GB of space, but the VM will be
aware of the disk total size.</p>
<p>If you wish to use a qcow2 formatted disk for a VM, it becomes necessary
to pre-provision disk with qemu-img. Create your disk as
specified above, then include the disk path as part of the <code>--disk</code>
flag when installing with <code>virt-install</code>.</p>
<h4 id="adding-and-removing-disks">Adding and Removing Disks:</h4>
<p>At some point, it will become necessary to add or remove storage from a virtual machine. Attaching and detaching disks is accomplished with the detach-disk and attach-disk utilities from virsh.</p>
<p>To add a new virtual disk accomplish these steps:</p>
<p>Create a new virtual disk, as described above.</p>
<p>Execute the following command:</p>
<p><code>virsh attach-disk example_vm /path/to/disk/example_disk.img vdb --live --config</code></p>
<p>This attaches the disk ‘example_disk.img’ to the VM ‘example_vm’
as the virtual device ‘vdb’. When listed with the lsblk command,
there will now be two virtual disks: /dev/vda which the os was
installed on and /dev/vdb . This disk can be treated exactly as
any other type of directly attached storage; it can formatted,
partitioned or added to a RAID group.</p>
<p>There are several critical details to note here.</p>
<p>First, always use the absolute path to the disk.</p>
<p>Second, make sure that the target matches the target in the
operating system. For example if you attached the disk as
/dev/vdc but only on other virtual disk was attached in the OS,
then the disk would still appear in the OS /dev/vdb.
But the VM configuration would reflect /dev/vdc.
This can make troubleshooting disk problems difficult.</p>
<p>Third, note the flags used. <code>--live</code> immediately attaches the
disk, <code>--config</code> makes adds the disk to VM XML configuration.</p>
<p>Next, removing disks:</p>
<p>Before removing a disk, accomplish these steps:</p>
<p>Ensure no critical applications are running, or services are accessing the disk.</p>
<p>Dismount the disk:</p>
<p><code>umount /path/to/disk</code></p>
<p>Remove the disk entry from /etc/fstab. Rebooting with a dead entry to a disk can cause the OS to hang.</p>
<p>Detach the disk:</p>
<p><code>virsh detach-disk example_vm vdb --live --config</code></p>
<p>This will immediately detach the disk and remove it from the VM XML config.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Disks are created with qemu-img utility. Qcow2 disks are thin provisioned
and have advanced features including snapshots, while raw disks are highly portable and simpler.<br>
Attach disks with <code>virsh attach-disk</code> and detach disks with <code>virsh detach-disk</code>.
Always ensure that the attached disk target matches the VM’s target.</p>
