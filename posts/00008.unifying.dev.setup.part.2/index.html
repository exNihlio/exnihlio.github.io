  <div class="post-content">
    <p>A follow up my previous post about updating my dev environmet.</p>
<p>In the end, I switched to Alacritty. Honestly setting it up was a bit of a pain,
and is it really worth it? No idea. But I like the lack of tabs, which more
or less forces me to use tmux, as I previously mentioned. And I have an automated
build process with Docker configured that I&rsquo;ll put up on GitHub sometime.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have progressed quite a bit on configuring my .vimrc. Historically I have
never strayed far from defaults for a few reasons. First, I haved worked in number of secure
and/or airgapped environments where I can&rsquo;t bring in a custom .vimrc. Growing used to/dependent
on customization is difficult if you can&rsquo;t synchronize these settings. So I usually just did:
<code>set nu</code> and <code>set background=dark</code> and just lived with the rest. Same with tmux. This habit just
stuck with me. But then I worked at a company where I was editing a lot of SaltStack forumulas
(.sls) and Jinja2 templates (.template) and since these are still YAML files, I wanted syntax
highlighting.
So I ended up configuring my .vimrc to recognize these as such. And then got a nice PS1 configured
based on when I was using <code>fish</code> and ported it to back to <code>bash</code>. And thus was born my <code>dotfiles</code> repo.</p>
<p>But still, I ended up being pretty into Visual Studio Code, despite having misgivings about
the telemetry and supporting a product that has of sucked all the oxygen out of the room with
regards to graphical text editors. I know one person who still uses Sublime and even they are
considering switching. But momentum is powerful and when you&rsquo;re engaged with various customers,
it is easy to request VS Code on your customer provided gear. Everyone knows what it is, and chances
are most of their dev team is already using it. And the built-in stuff like remote editing or editing
in a container is pretty sexy. Yes, Vim works over SSH too, but VS Code handles latency spikes
far better. As in, it actually seems to handle latency spikes.</p>
<p>Ultimately the shell still calls to me. I do not like using VS Code&rsquo;s built Git tooling and just
defaulted to using <code>git</code> in the shell. Which meant I was always switching windows. And again,
the telemetry and the fact that I am supporting a bit of an editor hegemony. I considered switching to
VS Codium but it is ulimately a worse version of VS Code. So here I am.</p>
<p>I think my choices split the difference between heavy customization and sticking to defaults.
I have installed a single plugin at the moment, and that&rsquo;s just a color palette,
<a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">gruvbox</a> which I absolutely adore. I have configured Alacritty to
use the same colors as well.</p>
<p>For file browsing I am using <code>netrw</code> with a few small customizations gleaned from
<a href="https://shapeshed.com/vim-netrw/">here</a>. This gives me exactly what I want, a file browser tucked off
to the left and opening files to the right.</p>
<p>Right now I am investigating Git plugins and looking at
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a>. I do not need complex things. I need simple
things that add a bit of polish and reduced friction to existing tooling.</p>
