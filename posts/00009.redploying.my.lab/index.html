    <p>Turns out that hacking on my terminal, text editor and tmux configuration was a dangerous
thing, since now I am in the process of rebuilding my homelab, for something like the fourth or fifth
time.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-background">A Bit of Background</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been an erstwhile homelabber for the past six years or so. This started when I was pivoting
my career from electronics technician to sysadmin. My first &ldquo;lab&rdquo; was a simple Intel Skylake box, 16GB
of DDR4, a small SSD and some spinning rust. Very basic, but I used KVM/QEMU and libvirt to spin
up VMs and spent a lot of time prepping for the RHCSA. This proved to be prtty effective, since the
RHCSA cert is very focused on manual tasks. So manually doing these tasks was how I did it; manually
deploying VMs with <code>virt-install</code> and manually configuring services.</p>
<p>After the RHCSA and starting a new job, I became increasingly focused on automation. Ansible became my
tool of choice, and I was doing a lot of scripting with Python and Perl. At that point, I upgraded my
lab, getting a Dell R510, stuffing it with some extra hard drives, NVME and networking. This
expanded my resources, but my automation was still lacking. I had added some scripts for deploying
virtual machines, but it was brittle and not really scalable. VMWare is just too cumbersome and
obtuse, CloudStack and Open Nebula are promising, but it&rsquo;s a lot to set up and you turn into a
sysadmin just to be able to run things. OpenStack is a whole different mess.</p>
<p>Regardless, this process has persisted for a long time. My lab has always been chaotic. A while back I
created a couple of Ansible playbooks for deploying machines, but again these were messy and brittle.
Ansible doesn&rsquo;t really have direct hooks into libvirt and so the playbooks are non-idempotent.
Theoretically you can just render XML files and define your VMs there but that is a path of utter pain
there.</p>
<p>SaltStack can do virtualization management as well, but the documentation was very lacking the last
time I looked.</p>
<p>I had considered just setting up K8s on baremetal, but it makes maintenance a challenge.</p>
<p>So for the longest time, my lab has languished. Very much a &ldquo;cobbler&rsquo;s children have no shoes&rdquo;
situation. And it is embarassing.</p>
<h2 id="enter-ignite">Enter Ignite</h2>
<p>About six months ago, I stumbled onto <a href="https://www.weave.works/blog/fire-up-your-vms-with-weave-ignite">Ignite</a>
from WeaveWorks. This is absolutely one of the sexiest virtual machine tools I have played with.
It is fast, very simple in terms of operation and functionality and you can just write a simple yaml
file, put it in Git and have a new VM running. This is exactly what I need.</p>
<h2 id="setting-it-up">Setting it up</h2>
<p>The idea is to have KVM and Ignite be the virtualization layer for my lab. Ignite will run disposable
VMs and I can run experiments there. Clean up is easy and it should integrate well
existing source control.</p>
<p>Before I can do any of this though, there&rsquo;s prep work. I want my lab to well managed this time. So I
am deploying a number of supporting services to that end. First, I set up Hashicorp Vault for secrets
management. No more messing Ansible Vault directly. Next was Portainer and Docker Registry for image
management. Currently working on Minio for object storage and Gitea for source control. After this will
come Jenkins, Atlantis, Prometheus and Grafana.</p>
<p>All of these services are running on my NAS, separate from the lab hardware itself. In theory, nothing
in my lab will manually deployed. VMs will run entirely in a GitOps fashion. Changes all go out through
CI/CD.</p>
<p>Since services in support of the lab are running on a single Docker host, I&rsquo;m using <code>docker-compose</code>
to manage them. Ansible renders the <code>docker-compose.yml</code>; this is for injecting variables, secrets and
managing variables. This is an ongoing process and I&rsquo;ll be adding more details as I proceed.</p>
